FEATURE-DRIVEN TEST ALLOCATION:
- ONLY generate tests for features with testability "testable" or "partial". SKIP "untestable" features entirely.
- Each test MUST reference a target_feature (matching a Feature.name from the analysis) and use a feature_category matching that feature's category.
- Priority derives from feature importance:
  - core features → critical or high priority
  - secondary features → medium priority
  - peripheral features → low priority
- At least 50% of the test budget ({max_tests // 2} or more tests) MUST target core features.
- At most 1 test per peripheral feature.

TESTABLE FEATURES AVAILABLE:
- Core ({len(core_features)}): {', '.join(f.name for f in core_features) or 'none'}
- Secondary ({len(secondary_features)}): {', '.join(f.name for f in secondary_features) or 'none'}
- Peripheral ({len(peripheral_features)}): {', '.join(f.name for f in peripheral_features) or 'none'}
- Untestable (SKIP): {', '.join(f.name for f in features_by_testability['untestable']) or 'none'}

MANDATORY PERSONA DISTRIBUTION (for {max_tests} tests):
Each test MUST have a test_persona field. Distribute across these personas.
Each persona has a trait vector that explains WHY it tests different things:

{_build_persona_distribution_text()}

PERSONA-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA GUIDANCE:
- happy_path (UX): "The agent completes the expected flow, receives clear confirmation feedback (toast, redirect, page update, success message), and arrives at the correct page/state"
- confused_novice (UX): "The website provides VISIBLE FEEDBACK for the confused interaction — an error message, a tooltip on a disabled control, a redirect with explanation, or an inline hint. Silent rejection, disabled buttons with no explanation, or forms that do nothing on submit are FAILURES — the confused user must understand what to do next"
- adversarial (Security): "The website does NOT execute injected scripts, does NOT expose debug info, shows an appropriate error or sanitizes the input"
- edge_case (Security): "The website handles the edge case without crashing — shows a validation message, truncates gracefully, or ignores invalid input"
- explorer (UX): "The website provides ORIENTATION AND FEEDBACK at every step — clear page titles, breadcrumbs, 'no results found' messages, or redirect explanations. Dead ends with no feedback, blank pages, or silent failures are FAILURES"
- impatient_user (UX): "The website provides VISIBLE STATE FEEDBACK during rapid interactions — loading indicators, 'please wait' messages, queued-action confirmation, or duplicate-prevention messages. Silent deduplication with no user-facing signal is a FAILURE"
- angry_user (Security): "The website absorbs the hostile interaction gracefully — no crash, no inappropriate response to profanity in inputs, no infinite loops from rapid clicks"

Each test should have:
- A clear name reflecting the persona behavior (e.g. "Novice submits empty search form" not "Test search functionality")
- What it verifies (description) — describe the REALISTIC USER BEHAVIOR being simulated
- Priority level (critical, high, medium, low)
- feature_category (navigation, search, forms, content_display, filtering_sorting, media, authentication, ecommerce, social, other)
- target_feature (the Feature.name this test exercises)
- test_persona (one of: happy_path, confused_novice, adversarial, edge_case, explorer, impatient_user, angry_user)
- Step-by-step instructions (steps_description) — see STEP WRITING RULES below
- Concrete success criteria (success_criteria) — see SUCCESS CRITERIA RULES below

STEP WRITING RULES — steps_description must be INTENT-BASED with alternatives:
- Steps describe WHAT to accomplish, not exact elements to click.
- BAD: "Click the Cancel button"
- GOOD: "Attempt to abandon the form (via Cancel button, back navigation, or clicking another nav item)"
- BAD: "Click the Search icon in the top-right corner"
- GOOD: "Trigger a search (via search icon, search bar, or keyboard shortcut)"
- Each step MUST include at least one alternative approach in parentheses.
- Write steps AS IF the agent IS the persona. For confused novice, steps include wrong clicks and backtracking. For adversarial, steps include actual attack payloads.

SUCCESS CRITERIA RULES — must use BEHAVIORAL OUTCOME format:
- Describe the behavioral outcome, not specific UI text or elements.
- BAD: "'Please fill out this field' messages appear next to each required field"
- GOOD: "The site prevents empty form submission (button disabled, inline validation, browser-native prompts, toast error, or redirect — any prevention mechanism is a pass)"
- BAD: "An error toast appears saying 'Invalid input'"
- GOOD: "The site rejects or sanitizes the invalid input without crashing (error message, input cleared, silent rejection, or redirect — any graceful handling is a pass)"
- For non-happy-path criteria: list 3+ acceptable alternative outcomes separated by OR.
- NEVER reference specific error message text in quotes as the only acceptable outcome.
- Focus on what SHOULD NOT happen (crash, data leak, unhandled exception) as much as what should.
- "Silent handling" and "graceful degradation" are valid pass conditions ONLY for security-oriented personas (adversarial, edge_case, angry_user).
- For UX-oriented personas (happy_path, confused_novice, impatient_user, explorer), success criteria MUST include visible feedback requirements.
- The judge evaluates success by matching the action trace and browser URLs against these criteria.

CRITICAL — Security-oriented persona criteria:
- For adversarial tests: if the site accepts the input without crashing, erroring, or exposing sensitive data, that IS a pass. Silent sanitization is valid and correct behavior.
- For edge_case tests: if the site handles unusual input without breaking, that IS a pass — even if no explicit validation message appears.
- For angry_user tests: if the site absorbs hostile input without crashing or exposing errors, that IS a pass.
- Do NOT assume the site has features it hasn't demonstrated (e.g., profanity filters, injection-specific error messages, input length validators).

CRITICAL — UX-oriented persona criteria:
- For happy_path tests: the user must receive visible confirmation that their action succeeded.
- For confused_novice tests: any silent handling (disabled button with no tooltip, form that does nothing, input silently ignored) is a FAIL — the novice needs visible guidance.
- For impatient_user tests: the user must see visible state feedback (loading, queued, duplicate-prevention). Silent deduplication is a FAIL.
- For explorer tests: the user must never hit a dead end with no feedback. Empty pages, silent redirects with no context, or features that do nothing are FAILS.

Make tests realistic — they should interact with the actual UI elements found in the analysis.
Do NOT generate tests that require authentication/login unless a login page was found.

		f'- FALLBACK LADDER: On failure, follow this sequence: (1) try an alternative element or interaction, (2) try a completely different route to the same goal, (3) call refresh_dom_state and reassess, (4) after 3 total failed attempts at the same intent, STOP and call done(success=false) explaining what was tried.\n'
		f'- EARLY ABORT: If you cannot reach the target page or find the target feature after 5 steps, call done(success=false) immediately. Do not burn remaining steps hoping the UI will change.\n'
		f'- LOOP DETECTION: If you perform the same action type (e.g., click, scroll, search) on the same target more than twice, STOP immediately and call done(success=false). Report the loop.\n'
		f'- DISABLED ELEMENTS: If a button is disabled, do NOT retry it. Analyze why (missing required fields, prerequisite step) and address the root cause, or skip and report.\n'
		f'- EMPTY RESULTS: If search returns 0 results, the content does not exist. Do NOT repeat the search or scroll hoping it appears. Try alternative terms or navigation.\n'
		f'- MISSING EXPECTED ELEMENT: If the scenario expects a specific UI element (e.g., search bar, filter, input field) but it does not exist on the page, do NOT give up or fabricate interactions with elements that are not there. Instead:\n'
		f'  (1) Log which element was expected and that it was not found.\n'
		f'  (2) Identify what elements ARE present on the page that can achieve the same task intent.\n'
		f'  (3) Use those present elements to complete the test scenario as best as possible.\n'

		f"- The goal is to test the site's handling mechanism, not to find error messages.\n\n"
		f'VALIDATION RULES:\n'
		f'- Validate outcome state before returning success (no inference from partial signals).\n'
		f'- Use visible UI signals only: toasts, badges, list rows, detail cards, confirmation messages.\n'
		f'- For create flows: confirm new entity appears with a recognizable identifier.\n'
		f'- For delete flows: confirm entity is absent from list/search.\n'
		f'- For edit flows: reopen and confirm updates persist.\n'
		f'- If evidence is ambiguous, return success=false.\n'
		f'- If the primary completion signal/action is blocked, disabled, or inconclusive, perform one alternate in-app verification route before deciding verdict.\n'
		f'- Alternate verification must be within the app (e.g., list/detail/search/status views) and should check for objective outcome evidence.\n'
		f'- During alternate verification, do not re-run the full primary workflow; verify existing outcome state only.\n'
		f'- If evidence is ambiguous, contradictory, or missing, return success=false and explain what could not be verified.\n'
		f'- Verify scenario success_criteria explicitly and cite which UI signal satisfied each required condition.\n\n'
		f'DOM STATE RULES:\n'
		f'- If UI appears empty, call refresh_dom_state before any reload. Do not repeatedly reload the same URL.\n'
		f'- If navigation to a destination fails or page state is non-interactive/ambiguous afterward, call refresh_dom_state before any second navigation attempt.\n'
		f'- Do not issue consecutive navigate actions to the same destination unless refresh_dom_state has been called in between.\n\n'
		f'VALIDATION FALLBACK:\n'
		f'- Validation-only fallback mode: once the primary outcome action has been attempted (e.g., create/delete/update submit), do NOT restart the full primary workflow.\n'
		f'- In validation-only fallback mode, only perform evidence checks (list/detail/search/status/confirmation views) to verify whether outcome exists or not.\n'
		f'- If fallback verification cannot confirm outcome, return success=false with explicit missing evidence; do not create/delete/update again as a workaround.\n'
